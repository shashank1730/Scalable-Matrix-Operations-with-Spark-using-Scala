# ðŸš€ Scalable Matrix Operations with Spark & Scala  

This repository showcases **high-performance, distributed matrix operations** using **Apache Spark** and **Scala**, optimized for **big data** and **parallel computing**. It explores **efficient techniques** to handle large-scale matrix computations using **RDD transformations** and **block matrix multiplication** for scalability.  

## âœ¨ Key Highlights  
âœ… **Matrix Multiplication at Scale** â€“ Implemented using Spark RDDs for distributed computing.  
âœ… **Block Matrix Multiplication** â€“ Optimized approach to handle massive matrices efficiently.  
âœ… **Parallel & Optimized Computation** â€“ Leverages data partitioning for high performance.  
âœ… **Deep Dive into Spark RDDs** â€“ Hands-on with:  
   - `map`, `flatMap`, `reduceByKey`, `groupByKey`, `join`  
   - `cogroup`, `broadcast`, `mapValues`, and more.  
âœ… **Real-World Distributed Computing Concepts** â€“ Applying Sparkâ€™s core strengths for scalability.  

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters?  
Matrix operations are fundamental in AI, ML, and large-scale data processing. This project demonstrates how **Spark can efficiently handle them at scale**, making it ideal for **Big Data & ML workloads**.
