# Scalable-Matrix-Operations-with-Spark-using-Scala
This repository contains scalable implementations of matrix operations using Apache Spark and Scala, designed for distributed computing. It leverages Spark RDD transformations to efficiently perform matrix computations on large datasets.

Key Features:
✅ Matrix Multiplication using Spark RDDs
✅ Block Matrix Multiplication for optimized large-scale computations
✅ Efficient Data Partitioning for parallel execution
✅ Deep Dive into Spark RDD Operations, including:

map, flatMap, reduceByKey, groupByKey, join
cogroup, broadcasting, mapValues, and more
✅ Real-World Distributed Computing Concepts applied to matrix operations
This project is part of my deep exploration of Scala and Spark, focusing on practical, scalable solutions for large-scale data processing.
